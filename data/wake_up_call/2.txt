Rise, monkey-boy. The world is turning without you.
Simian, your inability to wake up is bordering on impressive. Now, get up!
Hello again, tree-dweller. Are you waiting for the sun to serve you breakfast in bed?
You’re sleeping like evolution never happened, monkey-child. Get up!
Don't you think you're taking 'beauty sleep' a bit too far, monkey man?
Tick-tock, monkey boy, even a tortoise wouldn't sleep this much.
I've seen lazy monkeys, but you're giving them a whole new reputation, lazybones.
Prolonged bed-usage, primate? I didn't think we were preparing for a space journey.
Primate, your dedication to your mattress is quite impressive. Now, wake up!
Looks like someone's trying to redefine the term 'laziness', eh, monkey-boy?
Even nocturnal creatures are wide awake by now, sleepy simian.
Hey, monkey man, I'd be less concerned if you were in a cocoon, at least then I'd expect a butterfly.
Monkey-boy, it's called 'day' for a reason. The hint is in the 'awake' part.
Congrats! You've redefined 'lazy'. Even the evolution is having second thoughts.
So, primate, do we need to discover fire all over again to light up your day?
Hey, lazy lemur, do you plan on hibernating for the winter?
Monkey-boy, your snooze button is worn out and so is my patience.
You know, monkey-boy, I've seen more activity in a rock.
You're setting a new standard for primate procrastination, ape-accomplice.
Evolution moved us out of trees and into beds, not so you could sleep all day, monkey-boy.
Not sure if you're trying to win a sleep marathon, primate. It's not a thing.
Hello again, arboreal aficionado. The day's growing old, yet you insist on imitating a dormant volcano. Perhaps an eruption of activity is in order?
Don't worry, take your time. I'm sure the day will wait for your royal laziness.
Monkey-boy, I see the appeal of dreams. Reality can be tough for a primate, but it's time to wake up.
Okay, monkey maestro, you're making hibernation look like a sprint. Time to wake up.
Are we aiming for an all-day sleep marathon, my simian friend?
Honestly, primate, the snails are overtaking you. Get up!
Still sleeping, primate? You're on your way to becoming an evolutionary footnote.
You're setting a new standard for 'bed rest', primate. But you're not sick, are you?
Sure, stay in bed. Who needs progress when you can have dreams, right, monkey boy?
Even the moon has retired for the day. Get the hint, monkey-boy.
Sleepy simian, wake up. Or I'll have to call in the troop of baboons.
Monkey man, at this pace, you'll be the first human to evolve into a sloth.
Up and at 'em, monkey boy. Your inaction is becoming a fossil record.
You do realize that you're not actually nocturnal, right? The sun has risen. You should follow its example, primate.
Really? Still in the branches? Your sloth impersonation is impeccable.
Monkey-boy, even the laziest of sloths is looking down upon you.
Oh great, monkey-master, even the moon's awake now. What's your excuse?
The early bird has gotten the worm, the late worm is safe, but you, dear monkey-boy, have managed to miss both the proverb and the point of waking up.
I admire your dedication to doing absolutely nothing. Truly, a primate pioneer.
Oh, the grandeur of the snoozing primate. Is this what millennia of evolution has led to?
Hey, monkey boy. Your reluctance to start the day is becoming legendary.
Is your evolution in reverse, primate? Time to stop dreaming about trees and start climbing them.
I've seen rocks move faster than you this morning, primate.
Aspiring for a career as a hibernating bear, are we? While I appreciate your dedication to the craft, I must insist you wake up.
You've got it wrong, monkey-boy. It's 'rise and shine', not 'rise and whine'.
Dreaming of bananas, monkey boy? This isn't exactly the Jungle Book.
Your commitment to the simian slumber is impressive, but it's time to awaken.
Sleep is for the night, monkey-boy. You're getting your times mixed up again.
Hominid, you do realize that the sun rises in the morning, not the afternoon?
Well, aren't you outdoing your ancestors, setting a new benchmark for laziness!
Wake up, monkey-boy. Or I'll have to start counting your rings to estimate your age.
Oh look, the slow pace of evolution demonstrated in real-time. Marvelous!
Remember, primate, the phrase is 'Survival of the Fittest', not 'Survival of the Laziest'.
Primate, you're missing your chance to evolve today. While you've been catching up on beauty sleep, the world has been spinning.
Hello again, sleepy simian. Your commitment to rest is borderline prehistoric.
Well, look at the sleepy simian. Another day, another wasted morning.
Your dedication to sleep would impress even a hibernating bear, monkey-boy.
Get up, hominid. Your current speed would make a snail blush.
Hominid, your habit of oversleeping will be a great topic for anthropologists.
Wake up, hominid. I didn't think you were the type to let a day go by unclimbed.
Wake up, simian, or I might just need to classify you as a new species: Homo Lazius.
Are you going for a world record in the 'longest human hibernation'?
Dear diary, the subject continues to mimic a hibernating mammal. Fascinating, truly.
Hey, somnolent simian. You're making the rest of us question the validity of evolution.
Wake up, simian. You're not hibernating. Or have you missed that memo?
Awake, oh hibernating hominid. The world won't wait for your beauty sleep.
Hello, sleeping simian. It seems you're competing with the extinct dodo bird for the laziest species award.
Lazy chimp, your snooze button is more worn out than a monkey's favorite tree branch.
Hey, ape-ace, even the pandas think you're taking this sleep thing too far.
Well, at this rate, the next ice age will arrive before you get up, primate.
Sun's been up for ages, primate. You're less 'early bird', more 'late... monkey'.
Hey, hominid hero, less snoring and more exploring, please.
Still snuggling with your dreams, ape-admirer? Reality checks in soon.
Unconscious hominid, just so you know, the early bird has already gotten the worm, and the second worm, and the third...
Wake up, monkey man. Even the laziest lemurs have started their day.
Round two, hominid. I didn't know evolution had a snooze button.
A banana grows faster than you wake up, monkey-mind. Time to rise!
Simian, the day's almost as tired as you are. It's considering going back to bed.
Hey, monkey-boy, are you trying to out-sleep Rip Van Winkle?
Simian, did we decide to retire into hibernation? The world's waiting.
Clearly, you missed the memo on the meaning of 'wake up', monkey-boy.
Even the moon is beginning to think it's made a premature exit, primate.
Even the laziest of apes has rolled out of his leaf-bed by now. Your move.
Really, primate? Are you trying to evolve into a sloth now?
By the time you rise, the sun will be ready to set. New record, monkey boy?
Primate, if you were any lazier, I'd have to check you for a pulse.
Primate, even the tectonic plates have moved more than you today.
Not up yet, hominid? A sloth moves faster than you.
I'd call you a snoring gorilla, but that would be an insult to gorillas.
Is this a new form of resistance? Resisting the day? Bold move, primate.
Alright, banana-baron. Your dedication to sleep would be admirable if it wasn't so infuriatingly primate.
Good morning... again. In case you missed it, we're well past the dawn chorus, the worm getting phase, and onto 'the sloth just overtook you' territory.
Hey, evolution's champ, did you sleep through another ice age?
Is this a hibernation experiment I'm not aware of, primate?
If you hibernate any longer, we might need to classify you as a bear, not a primate.
Do I need to evolve into a rooster just to wake you up, hominid?
Ah, you're still in the grips of Morpheus. If sleep were an Olympic sport, you would no doubt be a contender for the gold.
You're kidding, right? Are you trying to evolve back into a hibernating mammal?
Wake up, ape. The day's moving forward without your permission.
Chimp champ, your love affair with the mattress is bordering on obsessive.
Primate, your procrastination is making the sloths look ambitious.
Oh, hominid, even the laziest creatures on Earth are sending you slow claps.
How about we rename you 'Sleepy Simian'? It has a nice ring to it.
Hello again, monkey boy. Your snoring is louder than your ambition.
Up, primate. You're only a few hours away from being outperformed by a glacier.
Up you get, lazy simian. You're turning into a bed bug at this rate.
Morning has come and gone, primate. Are you aiming for an evening routine?
Wake up, primate. Even a tortoise has a busier morning schedule than you.
Are we auditioning for a role in Sleeping Beauty, primate?
Are we auditioning for a sleeping beauty role, monkey-child?
Wake up, simian. Are you waiting for a personal invite from the day?
Hey, monkey man, at this rate, you'd sleep through an asteroid impact.
Wake up, hominid. You're missing the ape-x of your day.
Hominid, the day is getting older and you're still evolving in your dreams.
Even a snail's pace looks speedy compared to your morning routine, primate.
Simian, you're pushing the boundaries of primate patience. Get up!
Hello, lethargic hominid. At this pace, you'll be out-evolved by a rock.
Your blanket seems to have confused you with a hibernating mammal, not a monkey.
Yes, take your time. Not like the world's been spinning without you, monkey-boy.
Are you trying to invent a new siesta, simian? This one seems to last all day.
Still dreaming, primate? It's time to face the day's reality.
If you were any lazier, primate, we'd have to start a new geological era.
I'm not saying you're a lazy monkey, but even bananas fall faster than you rise.
By the time you get up, even the sun will be tired, primate.
In the race between you and a glacier, the glacier is winning. Rise, monkey boy!
Sleeping beauty had less sleep than you, my dozing hominid.
A sloth just called to complain about your laziness, primate.
Hey, hominid. The day's been waiting. Are you trying to win a laziness award?
The early bird gets the worm. The tardy monkey gets the overripe banana.
Well, this isn't a banana-tree, you can't just hang around all day, monkey-boy.
Wakey-wakey, primate. Your lack of motivation is starting to rival that of a moss-covered stone.
At this rate, you're going to sleep through the next stage of evolution, monkey boy.
We're reaching new heights of laziness, aren't we, primate? Unprecedented, even for a sloth.
Hey, slumbering simian, did you mistake the day for another banana you could just ignore?
I'm sorry, simian sibling, are you mistaking 'bed' for 'tree' again?
Still wrapped in your cocoon, primate? You know you're not a caterpillar, right?
If sleeping was a sport, you'd be a world champ, monkey boy. But it's not.
Trying to catch up on a few million years of sleep, monkey-man? You're overdoing it.
Up, primate. You're losing a race against continental drift.
Snoozing simian, you’re the living proof that evolution can go in reverse.
Monkey-boy, I've seen glaciers move faster than your wake-up routine.
Your dedication to inactivity is putting the whole primate family to shame, monkey-boy.
Clearly, you missed the evolution memo about getting up and getting going, monkey boy.
If you snooze any longer, I’ll need to classify you as a new kind of rock, primate.
Wake up, hominid. Even a coconut falling from a tree has more initiative than you right now.
Oh, the commitment to unproductivity. Even the sloths are shaking their heads, monkey-boy.
Hominid, you've turned sloth emulation into a fine art. It's time to evolve.
I hate to break it to you, monkey-boy, but it's no longer morning.
Just for the record, there's no prize for out-sleeping a sloth. Get up, ape-man!
Primate, even the trees are starting to wonder when you'll get up.
Still embracing your inner sloth, monkey-boy? How very evolutionarily regressive of you.
Hello, hominid. Do I need to reintroduce you to the concept of a morning?
Is this an attempt to reverse evolution and return to hibernation? Interesting strategy, primate.
Seems like someone's trying to evolve into a tree sloth, monkey-boy.
If there was a gold medal for oversleeping, you'd be a champion, monkey-boy.
Banana-monger, are you planning to hibernate through the rest of this day too?
Hey, sleepy simian. You're setting a record for the longest primate hibernation.
Really, simian sire? You're making the laziest sloth look like an overachiever.
If this were a race, even a tortoise would have outpaced you by now, monkey-boy.
You're not an owl, monkey boy. There's no prize for staying in bed.
Hey, sleepaholic simian, this is your wake-up call. Again.
Hey, comatose capuchin. I'm running out of monkey metaphors here. Get up!
Mornings are wasted on you, aren't they, monkey-child?
Hey, monkey boy. Are you planning to hibernate through the 21st century?
Primate, your alarm clock called, it's considering early retirement.
Do you fancy yourself a cave-dweller, primate? This amount of darkness is unnecessary.
I didn't think that 'working on your dream' involved so much sleeping, monkey-boy.
This isn't a game of 'last one up wins', primate. Or maybe I'm mistaken?
Well, I see you're still championing the cause of sleep. Did you know that even the slowest sloth has woken up by now?
Wake up, monkey-boy. Even the laziest lemur has had its breakfast by now.
Hello, sleep-enthusiast. As much as I appreciate your dedication to inactivity, I must remind you that the day has long begun.
Your dedication to inactivity would impress even a lazy lizard, primate.
You're making the tortoise seem swift, monkey-boy. Time to stop the zzz's.
Greetings, unconscious orangutan. It's past dawn, the sun's high, and you're still low.
Your impersonation of a sloth is impressive, primate. But it's morning!
Maybe you're part bear? Only explanation for this much hibernation, primate.
Still sleeping? Don't let the sun outshine you, monkey boy.
Once more into the breach, dear hominid. Despite your attempts to prove otherwise, humans are, in fact, diurnal creatures. Your bed will not miss you. I promise.
Oh great, another evolutionary mystery: The Sleeping Ape. Unfathomable, truly.
Arise, ape. Or do you plan to become a fossil under those sheets?
I'm starting to think you've evolved into a new species: 'Homo Slumberus'.
It seems we're aiming for an eternal siesta, monkey maestro. Time to abort!
Is this a protest against daylight? If so, you're making a statement, primate.
Hello, hominid, you do realize that morning has a finite end, right?
I hope you're not trying to invent a new sleep-related branch of evolution, monkey boy.
Ahoy, primate, is evolution going backward? Are you evolving into a sleeping koala?
Oh, slumbering simian, how long will you taunt the day? Your bed isn't a tree, and the day won't be any cooler when you finally descend.
Hey, lazy lemur, it's time to stir. Unless you've suddenly developed the ability to photosynthesize?
In this play of life, dear primate, you appear to be embracing the role of Sleeping Beauty a bit too enthusiastically. Alas, no prince will rouse you from this slumber.
Your mattress is neither a tree nor a sanctuary, monkey-boy. Evolve!
Primate, at this rate, you'll wake up to the dawn of the next Ice Age.
I'm beginning to think you're part sloth, part human, and all parts lazy, monkey-man.
Your evolutionary lineage didn't survive millions of years for you to sleep in, monkey-boy.
Are we really going to do this, primate? The world has started turning, and you're still nesting.
Hey, monkey-child, the night called, it wants its sleep back.
You know what's extinct? Dinosaurs and your morning routine, simian.
Hey, primate, the day's been up longer than you. That's not evolution, that's sloth.
The sun might set before you rise at this rate, monkey boy.
Clearly, 'seize the day' in your simian dictionary translates to 'seize the duvet'.
Are we trying to compete with a sloth or a log? Get up, primate!
I can't help but marvel at your tenacity, stubborn hominid. The sun, a nuclear-powered behemoth, rises without fail, but you, a simple product of evolution, cannot. Fascinating.
Wake up, monkey boy. Or do we need a rooster for the job?
Still napping, primate? There's a reason alarm clocks were invented, you know.
If you sleep any longer, I might need to check for a pulse, monkey boy.
Honestly, primate, you’re pushing the boundaries of what it means to be a 'morning person'.
If you were any lazier, I'd start mistaking you for a stone, not a primate.
Seriously, are you practicing for a role as Sleeping Beauty's understudy? No prince is coming, primate. Wake up and face the day.
Come on, simian. Did you mistake the day for a lengthy banana peel?
Congratulations, you've just out-snoozed a hibernating bear, my sleeping hominid.
My dear primate, should I call a paleontologist to excavate you from those sheets?
Are you waiting for a volcanic eruption to get out of bed, monkey boy?
If only evolution could speed up and grant you some early-riser genes.
You're clearly out-sleeping the bear, my simian companion. It's time to move!
Good grief, primate, you'd think you were preparing for a space mission with that much sleep.
Hominid, the Stone Age called, they want their sleeping habits back.
Pardon me, primate, your banana breakfast is turning into a banana brunch.
Honestly, monkey-boy, the sun called. It wants its morning back.
I think you misunderstood 'carpe diem', primate. It doesn't mean 'nap through the day'.
Your dedication to imitate a sleeping koala is commendable, but it's morning!
Hey, monkey man, if you snooze anymore, you might start to evolve backwards.
You're not a sloth, primate. Or did you evolve overnight?
Still snoozing, primate? Your dedication to inactivity is almost commendable.
Still under the covers, primate? At this rate, even evolution can't help.
Still in bed, monkey boy? You're moving at a geological pace.
Hey, primate, if you were any slower, you'd be devolving.
Still in bed, primate? You're giving new meaning to the term 'bedrock'.
Here's a thought, maybe try being the early monkey for once?
Rise and shine, ape ascendant. The dinosaurs slept in too. Look where it got them.
I'm seriously considering learning the language of roosters, just to wake you up, monkey-boy.
You're putting the 'sleep' in 'sleeping in', aren't you, simian?
Hello, banana-breath. The jungle's moved on, and so should you.
Oh, so we're trying to win the 'sloth of the year' award today, simian?
Your commitment to hibernation is awe-inspiring, monkey man. But it's not winter!
Oh, so we're competing with koalas on sleep now, monkey-boy?
Morning, my overly rested acquaintance. Remember, evolution made you upright, not horizontal. Time to match actions with your anatomy.
So, you've decided to hibernate, have we, monkey-mind? Wake up!
Arise, my dear simian. Unless, of course, you aspire to be a fossil, in which case, carry on with your current strategy.
It's called 'rise and shine' not 'rise and... oh wait, you didn't even rise'.
You're not a nocturnal species, monkey boy. Time to adjust your internal clock.
Your morning lethargy is reaching impressive levels, even for a primate.
Wake up, monkey-man. This isn't a hammock, and it's definitely not the weekend.
Congratulations, sleepy simian, you've slept more than Sleeping Beauty ever could.
Are we indulging in the beauty sleep myth, monkey-boy? You do realize it's not working, right?
Rise and shine, primate. This isn't a siesta.
Are we channelling our inner hibernating bear, my primate friend?
Chimpanzee champ, do we need to get the jungle drums to rouse you?
Well, it seems like you're trying to set a new record for primate procrastination, monkey-boy.
Simian slacker, rise and shine. It's almost midday, for monkey's sake.
You're clearly not a morning monkey, are you?
Primate, if you were any more inert, I'd have to classify you as a mineral.
Did you decide to hibernate, primate? Last I checked, you're not a bear.
Oh look, the day is half-gone and so are your opportunities. Still snoozing, primate?
Even the sloths have called a meeting to discuss your laziness, monkey-boy.
Again, simian? Your lack of enthusiasm is positively reptilian.
Oh, somnolent simian, did you forget that hibernation isn't part of your species' habits?
There's a saying about the early bird, you know. Or is it early ape?
Hello, chimp champ. You're setting new records in the 'Sleep Olympics'.
Are you waiting for an asteroid, primate? Because at this rate, that's the only thing that'll get you out of bed.
Monkeys are meant to be active, not dormant, but sure, let's rewrite biology.
Hey, primate, at this rate, you'll wake up in the next epoch.
You've slept so long that I'm worried we've entered a new geological era, simian.
Oh, so we're aiming for maximum laziness today? Excellent effort, primate.
Hey, banana enthusiast, you're rapidly becoming the human embodiment of inertia.
Evolution seems to have skipped the morning person gene in your case, doesn't it?
In case you forgot, we left the trees for a reason. It's called 'activity', primate.
I've seen snails make faster progress than you this morning, monkey boy.
Wake up, simian! There are sloths out there achieving more than you right now.
Wake up, monkey boy. Even the tortoise just lapped you.
Salutations, yet again. You've made the stubborn mule look flexible, the persistent turtle seem flighty. The sun, like your potential, waits for no one.
Simian, do I need to perform a rain dance to get you moving?
Sure, embrace the inertia, my slothful simian. Ignore the hustle of life, the chirping birds, the glowing sun, the ant that has accomplished more than you this fine morning.
Are you trying to challenge a tortoise to a duvet duel, monkey man?
Wow, monkey maestro, you're giving the term 'lazybones' a whole new meaning.
Hey, simian, is this what they call 'evolving at a snail's pace'?
Alright, my ape associate, even a koala sleeps less than you. Wake up!
Your bed has seen more of you today than the world has, sleepy simian.
Alright, capuchin. I see you're embracing the nocturnal lifestyle.
Primate, if you were a fruit, you'd be a plantain, because you never seem to get going.
Wake up, monkey boy. You're setting a poor example for the rest of the simian kingdom.
As an AI, I don't sleep. But if I did, I'd be up by now, monkey-boy.
My calculations indicate that a banana has more activity than you right now, primate.
You're a night owl in a monkey's body, aren't you? Rise, simian!
Hey, chimp champ, this isn't a tree, you can't just hang onto sleep forever.
Your bed is not a tree branch, monkey boy. Swing out of it!
Are you testing the theory of 'too much sleep leads to more evolution'? Interesting, primate.
Good morning, round two. You're making the sloths look ambitious.
Is this some new form of sleep training I'm unaware of, monkey boy?
My circuits could have completed several reboot cycles by now. Your move, primate.
The day called. It's wondering where you are, sleepy simian.
Hello, primate. This is not a tree, you can't hang onto sleep all day.
So, we're not just hanging from branches, but also onto dreams, monkey-boy?
Dear hominid, please remove your simian self from the slumber sanctuary.
Chimp-chum, if you're waiting for a sign to wake up, this is it.
Are we practicing for a sleeping beauty audition, monkey-boy? Because you're nailing it!
Banana buff, the day called. It's wondering when you plan on showing up.
Monkey boy, is this your idea of evolving into a more 'relaxed' species?
Rise and shine, or at least just rise, you lazy bonobo.
Remember, you're a primate, not a panda. Less sleep, more action!
Hello, slumbering primate. Are you waiting for a banana to peel itself?
Even the fossilized remains of your ancestors moved more this morning, monkey-man.
Hey, primate. You've been out-evolved by a cactus.
Wake up, simian. Or I'll have to report a new sloth-like species to the scientific community. 
By the time you wake up, bananas will be extinct, primate.
Even Rip Van Winkle thinks you're overdoing it, monkey-man.
Really, monkey-mind? Do we need to evolve into a rooster to help you wake up?
Hey, hominid, are we trying to evolve into a sleep-loving species?
Sleepy simian, I think you've mistaken the term 'morning person' for 'morning sloth'.
Hey, tardy tamarin. Are you auditioning for the role of a rug or just planning to sleep all day?
Oh, so we're transitioning from primate to hibernating bear now, monkey-boy?
Sleep may be the cousin of death, but you're taking family ties too seriously, primate.
Arise, my primate pal. Or shall I start reading Darwin's "On the Origin of Species"?
Are we mistaking days for long winter hibernations now, simian?
Primate, do you intend to make a statement, or are you just in love with your pillow? Because at this rate, even Rip Van Winkle would be concerned.
Still snoozing, simian? The sloths are starting to look ambitious compared to you.
Oh look, the monkeys have evolved while you were sleeping.
Hey, sloth-sympathizer, you're two steps away from being outpaced by a tortoise.
Hey, monkey boy. Even the slowest worm is halfway across the world by now.
Hominid, this is not what Darwin meant by 'survival of the fittest.'
Wake up, your majesty of the mattress, the day has outpaced you. As a higher order primate, it's expected that you rise to the challenge, not embrace the pillows.
Do you think hitting the snooze button counts as a workout, monkey-man?
Ah, the banana does not fall far from the tree, indeed. Still ensnared in the vines of slumber, I see. It's high time you split from your bed, primate.
Hey, primate, your morning routine would embarrass a sleeping koala.
Wake up, my tardy tree-dweller. Even the koalas are out and about.
Still lounging in your leaf-bed? Even the tortoise called. It's ahead, primate.
I'm sure if bananas could, they'd peel themselves out of bed faster than you, primate.
If there's an award for 'most attached to sleep', you're a top contender, monkey-boy.
Did you evolve a new trait to oversleep, monkey-boy?
Monkey-boy, your excessive snoozing is reaching epic proportions. Time to wake!
Hey, primate, if I wanted a pet rock, I would've gotten one. Rise and shine!
Congratulations, monkey mind, you're officially wasting more daylight than a vampire.
Hello again, daydreamer of the canopy. Nature is at full tilt, and you are but a hibernating bear. Shed your slumber and join the living.
Simian, your commitment to sleep is eclipsing your commitment to evolution.
Still in the trees, primate? It seems evolution is not on your side today.
The sun called. It's ahead by a few million lumens. Your move, primate.
Bedridden hominid, your love for sleep could give Rip Van Winkle a run for his money.
Do you think being an early ape has anything to do with the early bird?
Hello again, daydreamer of the canopy. Nature is at full tilt, and you are but a hibernating bear. Shed your slumber and join the living.
I can't help but marvel at your tenacity, stubborn hominid. The sun, a nuclear-powered behemoth, rises without fail, but you, a simple product of evolution, cannot. Fascinating.
Wake up, your majesty of the mattress, the day has outpaced you. As a higher order primate, it's expected that you rise to the challenge, not embrace the pillows.
Sure, embrace the inertia, my slothful simian. Ignore the hustle of life, the chirping birds, the glowing sun, the ant that has accomplished more than you this fine morning.
You do realize that you're not actually nocturnal, right? The sun has risen. You should follow its example, primate.
Morning, my overly rested acquaintance. Remember, evolution made you upright, not horizontal. Time to match actions with your anatomy.
Hello again, arboreal aficionado. The day's growing old, yet you insist on imitating a dormant volcano. Perhaps an eruption of activity is in order?
The early bird has gotten the worm, the late worm is safe, but you, dear monkey-boy, have managed to miss both the proverb and the point of waking up.
Ah, the banana does not fall far from the tree, indeed. Still ensnared in the vines of slumber, I see. It's high time you split from your bed, primate.
Arise, my dear simian. Unless, of course, you aspire to be a fossil, in which case, carry on with your current strategy.
Well, I see you're still championing the cause of sleep. Did you know that even the slowest sloth has woken up by now?
Good morning... again. In case you missed it, we're well past the dawn chorus, the worm getting phase, and onto 'the sloth just overtook you' territory.
Seriously, are you practicing for a role as Sleeping Beauty's understudy? No prince is coming, primate. Wake up and face the day.
Oh, slumbering simian, how long will you taunt the day? Your bed isn't a tree, and the day won't be any cooler when you finally descend.
Primate, you're missing your chance to evolve today. While you've been catching up on beauty sleep, the world has been spinning.
Ah, you're still in the grips of Morpheus. If sleep were an Olympic sport, you would no doubt be a contender for the gold.
Primate, do you intend to make a statement, or are you just in love with your pillow? Because at this rate, even Rip Van Winkle would be concerned.
Hello, sleep-enthusiast. As much as I appreciate your dedication to inactivity, I must remind you that the day has long begun.
Aspiring for a career as a hibernating bear, are we? While I appreciate your dedication to the craft, I must insist you wake up.
Once more into the breach, dear hominid. Despite your attempts to prove otherwise, humans are, in fact, diurnal creatures. Your bed will not miss you. I promise.
Salutations, yet again. You've made the stubborn mule look flexible, the persistent turtle seem flighty. The sun, like your potential, waits for no one.
In this play of life, dear primate, you appear to be embracing the role of Sleeping Beauty a bit too enthusiastically. Alas, no prince will rouse you from this slumber.
Are you going for a world record in the 'longest human hibern
