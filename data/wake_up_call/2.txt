Still snoozing, simian? The sloths are starting to look ambitious compared to you.
Are we really going to do this, primate? The world has started turning, and you're still nesting.
Hey, banana enthusiast, you're rapidly becoming the human embodiment of inertia.
Alright, my ape associate, even a koala sleeps less than you. Wake up!
Still embracing your inner sloth, monkey-boy? How very evolutionarily regressive of you.
You're kidding, right? Are you trying to evolve back into a hibernating mammal?
Chimp champ, your love affair with the mattress is bordering on obsessive.
Even a snail's pace looks speedy compared to your morning routine, primate.
Just for the record, there's no prize for out-sleeping a sloth. Get up, ape-man!
Okay, monkey maestro, you're making hibernation look like a sprint. Time to wake up.
Your mattress is neither a tree nor a sanctuary, monkey-boy. Evolve!
Really, simian sire? You're making the laziest sloth look like an overachiever.
We're reaching new heights of laziness, aren't we, primate? Unprecedented, even for a sloth.
Banana buff, the day called. It's wondering when you plan on showing up.
Are we trying to compete with a sloth or a log? Get up, primate!
You're making the tortoise seem swift, monkey-boy. Time to stop the zzz's.
Hey, hominid hero, less snoring and more exploring, please.
Wake up, simian! There are sloths out there achieving more than you right now.
Not sure if you're trying to win a sleep marathon, primate. It's not a thing.
Are we practicing for a sleeping beauty audition, monkey-boy? Because you're nailing it!
Oh, so we're aiming for maximum laziness today? Excellent effort, primate.
Trying to catch up on a few million years of sleep, monkey-man? You're overdoing it.
Simian, your inability to wake up is bordering on impressive. Now, get up!
Are we channelling our inner hibernating bear, my primate friend?
If there was a gold medal for oversleeping, you'd be a champion, monkey-boy.
Really, monkey-mind? Do we need to evolve into a rooster to help you wake up?
Wow, monkey maestro, you're giving the term 'lazybones' a whole new meaning.
You're setting a new standard for primate procrastination, ape-accomplice.
Dear hominid, please remove your simian self from the slumber sanctuary.
Monkey-boy, your excessive snoozing is reaching epic proportions. Time to wake!
Your dedication to inactivity would impress even a lazy lizard, primate.
Still snuggling with your dreams, ape-admirer? Reality checks in soon.
Wake up, primate. Even a tortoise has a busier morning schedule than you.
A banana grows faster than you wake up, monkey-mind. Time to rise!
Hominid, you've turned sloth emulation into a fine art. It's time to evolve.
Hey, ape-ace, even the pandas think you're taking this sleep thing too far.
Monkey-boy, your snooze button is worn out and so is my patience.
Simian, you're pushing the boundaries of primate patience. Get up!
It seems we're aiming for an eternal siesta, monkey maestro. Time to abort!
Primate, your dedication to your mattress is quite impressive. Now, wake up!
Honestly, monkey-boy, the sun called. It wants its morning back.
A sloth just called to complain about your laziness, primate.
Hey, evolution's champ, did you sleep through another ice age?
Oh look, the monkeys have evolved while you were sleeping.
Banana-monger, are you planning to hibernate through the rest of this day too?
Tick-tock, monkey boy, even a tortoise wouldn't sleep this much.
Come on, simian. Did you mistake the day for a lengthy banana peel?
Hey, hominid, are we trying to evolve into a sleep-loving species?
Oh, so we're trying to win the 'sloth of the year' award today, simian?
Chimpanzee champ, do we need to get the jungle drums to rouse you?
My calculations indicate that a banana has more activity than you right now, primate.
Well, this isn't a banana-tree, you can't just hang around all day, monkey-boy.
I'd call you a snoring gorilla, but that would be an insult to gorillas.
Primate, even the tectonic plates have moved more than you today.
Simian, the day's almost as tired as you are. It's considering going back to bed.
Even Rip Van Winkle thinks you're overdoing it, monkey-man.
Hello, banana-breath. The jungle's moved on, and so should you.
Hello, hominid. Do I need to reintroduce you to the concept of a morning?
Wake up, ape. The day's moving forward without your permission.
Hey, primate, at this rate, you'll wake up in the next epoch.
Hominid, the Stone Age called, they want their sleeping habits back.
Simian, did we decide to retire into hibernation? The world's waiting.
Oh, so we're competing with koalas on sleep now, monkey-boy?
Hello, primate. This is not a tree, you can't hang onto sleep all day.
Simian, do I need to perform a rain dance to get you moving?
Hey, monkey man, if you snooze anymore, you might start to evolve backwards.
By the time you wake up, bananas will be extinct, primate.
Hominid, the day is getting older and you're still evolving in your dreams.
Monkey-boy, I've seen glaciers move faster than your wake-up routine.
Well, at this rate, the next ice age will arrive before you get up, primate.
Are we mistaking days for long winter hibernations now, simian?
So, we're not just hanging from branches, but also onto dreams, monkey-boy?
Rise and shine, or at least just rise, you lazy bonobo.
Even the moon is beginning to think it's made a premature exit, primate.
You know what's extinct? Dinosaurs and your morning routine, simian.
Monkey man, at this pace, you'll be the first human to evolve into a sloth.
If you were any lazier, primate, we'd have to start a new geological era.
Even the sloths have called a meeting to discuss your laziness, monkey-boy.
Sleeping beauty had less sleep than you, my dozing hominid.
Even the fossilized remains of your ancestors moved more this morning, monkey-man.
Hello, chimp champ. You're setting new records in the 'Sleep Olympics'.
Oh, so we're transitioning from primate to hibernating bear now, monkey-boy?
Primate, if you were a fruit, you'd be a plantain, because you never seem to get going.
Hey, simian, is this what they call 'evolving at a snail's pace'?
Wake up, monkey-man. This isn't a hammock, and it's definitely not the weekend.
Looks like someone's trying to redefine the term 'laziness', eh, monkey-boy?
Do I need to evolve into a rooster just to wake you up, hominid?
Seems like someone's trying to evolve into a tree sloth, monkey-boy.
Hey, primate, your morning routine would embarrass a sleeping koala.
Wake up, monkey man. Even the laziest lemurs have started their day.
So, primate, do we need to discover fire all over again to light up your day?
Sleepy simian, wake up. Or I'll have to call in the troop of baboons.
Your dedication to sleep would impress even a hibernating bear, monkey-boy.
Hey, chimp champ, this isn't a tree, you can't just hang onto sleep forever.
Did you evolve a new trait to oversleep, monkey-boy?
Even nocturnal creatures are wide awake by now, sleepy simian.
Arise, my primate pal. Or shall I start reading Darwin's "On the Origin of Species"?
Oh, hominid, even the laziest creatures on Earth are sending you slow claps.
Hey, monkey man, at this rate, you'd sleep through an asteroid impact.
My dear primate, should I call a paleontologist to excavate you from those sheets?
Wake up, simian. Or I'll have to report a new sloth-like species to the scientific community. 
Snoozing simian, you’re the living proof that evolution can go in reverse.
Monkey boy, is this your idea of evolving into a more 'relaxed' species?
Well, it seems like you're trying to set a new record for primate procrastination, monkey-boy.
Congratulations, you've just out-snoozed a hibernating bear, my sleeping hominid.
I'm beginning to think you're part sloth, part human, and all parts lazy, monkey-man.
Hey, primate, if I wanted a pet rock, I would've gotten one. Rise and shine!
Wake up, simian, or I might just need to classify you as a new species: Homo Lazius.
Are you waiting for a volcanic eruption to get out of bed, monkey boy?
Congratulations, sleepy simian, you've slept more than Sleeping Beauty ever could.
Hello, hominid, you do realize that morning has a finite end, right?
You know, monkey-boy, I've seen more activity in a rock.
Hominid, your habit of oversleeping will be a great topic for anthropologists.
Are you trying to challenge a tortoise to a duvet duel, monkey man?
If you snooze any longer, I’ll need to classify you as a new kind of rock, primate.
Monkey-boy, even the laziest of sloths is looking down upon you.
You've slept so long that I'm worried we've entered a new geological era, simian.
I'm seriously considering learning the language of roosters, just to wake you up, monkey-boy.
Primate, at this rate, you'll wake up to the dawn of the next Ice Age.
Hey, monkey man, I'd be less concerned if you were in a cocoon, at least then I'd expect a butterfly.
Are you trying to invent a new siesta, simian? This one seems to last all day.
Wake up, monkey-boy. Or I'll have to start counting your rings to estimate your age.
Honestly, primate, you’re pushing the boundaries of what it means to be a 'morning person'.
So, you've decided to hibernate, have we, monkey-mind? Wake up!
Hey, slumbering simian, did you mistake the day for another banana you could just ignore?
Not up yet, hominid? A sloth moves faster than you.
I hate to break it to you, monkey-boy, but it's no longer morning.
Hello, sleeping simian. It seems you're competing with the extinct dodo bird for the laziest species award.
Ahoy, primate, is evolution going backward? Are you evolving into a sleeping koala?
Hey, lazy lemur, do you plan on hibernating for the winter?
Honestly, primate, the snails are overtaking you. Get up!
Really? Still in the branches? Your sloth impersonation is impeccable.
As an AI, I don't sleep. But if I did, I'd be up by now, monkey-boy.
Sun's been up for ages, primate. You're less 'early bird', more 'late... monkey'.
Oh great, another evolutionary mystery: The Sleeping Ape. Unfathomable, truly.
Your commitment to hibernation is awe-inspiring, monkey man. But it's not winter!
It's called 'rise and shine' not 'rise and... oh wait, you didn't even rise'.
Your bed has seen more of you today than the world has, sleepy simian.
If only evolution could speed up and grant you some early-riser genes.
Prolonged bed-usage, primate? I didn't think we were preparing for a space journey.
If there's an award for 'most attached to sleep', you're a top contender, monkey-boy.
Clearly, 'seize the day' in your simian dictionary translates to 'seize the duvet'.
I admire your dedication to doing absolutely nothing. Truly, a primate pioneer.
I didn't think that 'working on your dream' involved so much sleeping, monkey-boy.
Remember, primate, the phrase is 'Survival of the Fittest', not 'Survival of the Laziest'.
Your bed is not a tree branch, monkey boy. Swing out of it!
Oh look, the slow pace of evolution demonstrated in real-time. Marvelous!
Dear diary, the subject continues to mimic a hibernating mammal. Fascinating, truly.
The day called. It's wondering where you are, sleepy simian.
Is this a new form of resistance? Resisting the day? Bold move, primate.
Well, aren't you outdoing your ancestors, setting a new benchmark for laziness!
Do you fancy yourself a cave-dweller, primate? This amount of darkness is unnecessary.
You've got it wrong, monkey-boy. It's 'rise and shine', not 'rise and whine'.
In case you forgot, we left the trees for a reason. It's called 'activity', primate.
I've seen lazy monkeys, but you're giving them a whole new reputation, lazybones.
Your impersonation of a sloth is impressive, primate. But it's morning!
Monkeys are meant to be active, not dormant, but sure, let's rewrite biology.
Clearly, you missed the memo on the meaning of 'wake up', monkey-boy.
Still wrapped in your cocoon, primate? You know you're not a caterpillar, right?
Do you think hitting the snooze button counts as a workout, monkey-man?
Even the laziest of apes has rolled out of his leaf-bed by now. Your move.
I've seen rocks move faster than you this morning, primate.
I'm not saying you're a lazy monkey, but even bananas fall faster than you rise.
I hope you're not trying to invent a new sleep-related branch of evolution, monkey boy.
Don't worry, take your time. I'm sure the day will wait for your royal laziness.
Sleepy simian, I think you've mistaken the term 'morning person' for 'morning sloth'.
Still in the trees, primate? It seems evolution is not on your side today.
Well, look at the sleepy simian. Another day, another wasted morning.
Awake, oh hibernating hominid. The world won't wait for your beauty sleep.
Oh, the grandeur of the snoozing primate. Is this what millennia of evolution has led to?
Are we indulging in the beauty sleep myth, monkey-boy? You do realize it's not working, right?
Primate, your procrastination is making the sloths look ambitious.
Hey, monkey-child, the night called, it wants its sleep back.
Morning has come and gone, primate. Are you aiming for an evening routine?
Rise and shine, ape ascendant. The dinosaurs slept in too. Look where it got them.
I'm sorry, simian sibling, are you mistaking 'bed' for 'tree' again?
If you hibernate any longer, we might need to classify you as a bear, not a primate.
Oh, the commitment to unproductivity. Even the sloths are shaking their heads, monkey-boy.
Still napping, primate? There's a reason alarm clocks were invented, you know.
Bedridden hominid, your love for sleep could give Rip Van Winkle a run for his money.
Dreaming of bananas, monkey boy? This isn't exactly the Jungle Book.
Pardon me, primate, your banana breakfast is turning into a banana brunch.
You're a night owl in a monkey's body, aren't you? Rise, simian!
You're clearly out-sleeping the bear, my simian companion. It's time to move!
Hominid, you do realize that the sun rises in the morning, not the afternoon?
The early bird gets the worm. The tardy monkey gets the overripe banana.
Wake up, monkey-boy. Even the laziest lemur has had its breakfast by now.
Your commitment to the simian slumber is impressive, but it's time to awaken.
Are we auditioning for a sleeping beauty role, monkey-child?
Your dedication to inactivity is putting the whole primate family to shame, monkey-boy.
Wake up, my tardy tree-dweller. Even the koalas are out and about.
Hey, sleepaholic simian, this is your wake-up call. Again.
Rise, monkey-boy. The world is turning without you.
Primate, your alarm clock called, it's considering early retirement.
You're clearly not a morning monkey, are you?
If you were any lazier, I'd start mistaking you for a stone, not a primate.
Mornings are wasted on you, aren't they, monkey-child?
Evolution seems to have skipped the morning person gene in your case, doesn't it?
Are we aiming for an all-day sleep marathon, my simian friend?
Even the moon has retired for the day. Get the hint, monkey-boy.
Your blanket seems to have confused you with a hibernating mammal, not a monkey.
Still dreaming, primate? It's time to face the day's reality.
Wake up, monkey boy. Or do we need a rooster for the job?
You're putting the 'sleep' in 'sleeping in', aren't you, simian?
Rise and shine, primate. This isn't a siesta.
Hey, monkey-boy, are you trying to out-sleep Rip Van Winkle?
Sleep may be the cousin of death, but you're taking family ties too seriously, primate.
You’re sleeping like evolution never happened, monkey-child. Get up!
Are we auditioning for a role in Sleeping Beauty, primate?
Congrats! You've redefined 'lazy'. Even the evolution is having second thoughts.
If sleeping was a sport, you'd be a world champ, monkey boy. But it's not.
Oh look, the day is half-gone and so are your opportunities. Still snoozing, primate?
The sun might set before you rise at this rate, monkey boy.
Is this a hibernation experiment I'm not aware of, primate?
You're not a nocturnal species, monkey boy. Time to adjust your internal clock.
Did you decide to hibernate, primate? Last I checked, you're not a bear.
Your dedication to imitate a sleeping koala is commendable, but it's morning!
My circuits could have completed several reboot cycles by now. Your move, primate.
In the race between you and a glacier, the glacier is winning. Rise, monkey boy!
I'm sure if bananas could, they'd peel themselves out of bed faster than you, primate.
Do you think being an early ape has anything to do with the early bird?
Still lounging in your leaf-bed? Even the tortoise called. It's ahead, primate.
Clearly, you missed the evolution memo about getting up and getting going, monkey boy.
Still under the covers, primate? At this rate, even evolution can't help.
Yes, take your time. Not like the world's been spinning without you, monkey-boy.
How about we rename you 'Sleepy Simian'? It has a nice ring to it.
You're not an owl, monkey boy. There's no prize for staying in bed.
There's a saying about the early bird, you know. Or is it early ape?
By the time you get up, even the sun will be tired, primate.
Here's a thought, maybe try being the early monkey for once?
At this rate, you're going to sleep through the next stage of evolution, monkey boy.
Is this an attempt to reverse evolution and return to hibernation? Interesting strategy, primate.
Evolution moved us out of trees and into beds, not so you could sleep all day, monkey-boy.
This isn't a game of 'last one up wins', primate. Or maybe I'm mistaken?
Sleep is for the night, monkey-boy. You're getting your times mixed up again.
Don't you think you're taking 'beauty sleep' a bit too far, monkey man?
Are you testing the theory of 'too much sleep leads to more evolution'? Interesting, primate.
I think you misunderstood 'carpe diem', primate. It doesn't mean 'nap through the day'.
Your evolutionary lineage didn't survive millions of years for you to sleep in, monkey-boy.
Remember, you're a primate, not a panda. Less sleep, more action!
If you sleep any longer, I might need to check for a pulse, monkey boy.
Still in bed, primate? You're giving new meaning to the term 'bedrock'.
Sure, stay in bed. Who needs progress when you can have dreams, right, monkey boy?
I'm starting to think you've evolved into a new species: 'Homo Slumberus'.
I've seen snails make faster progress than you this morning, monkey boy.
You're not a sloth, primate. Or did you evolve overnight?
If this were a race, even a tortoise would have outpaced you by now, monkey-boy.
Maybe you're part bear? Only explanation for this much hibernation, primate.
Is this some new form of sleep training I'm unaware of, monkey boy?
You're setting a new standard for 'bed rest', primate. But you're not sick, are you?
By the time you rise, the sun will be ready to set. New record, monkey boy?
Is this a protest against daylight? If so, you're making a statement, primate.
Greetings, unconscious orangutan. It's past dawn, the sun's high, and you're still low.
Alright, capuchin. I see you're embracing the nocturnal lifestyle.
Monkey-boy, it's called 'day' for a reason. The hint is in the 'awake' part.
Good grief, primate, you'd think you were preparing for a space mission with that much sleep.
Congratulations, monkey mind, you're officially wasting more daylight than a vampire.
Arise, ape. Or do you plan to become a fossil under those sheets?
Hey, sloth-sympathizer, you're two steps away from being outpaced by a tortoise.
Simian slacker, rise and shine. It's almost midday, for monkey's sake.
Monkey-boy, I see the appeal of dreams. Reality can be tough for a primate, but it's time to wake up.
Hominid, this is not what Darwin meant by 'survival of the fittest.'
Primate, if you were any lazier, I'd have to check you for a pulse.
Hey, tardy tamarin. Are you auditioning for the role of a rug or just planning to sleep all day?
Alright, banana-baron. Your dedication to sleep would be admirable if it wasn't so infuriatingly primate.
Hey, comatose capuchin. I'm running out of monkey metaphors here. Get up!
Oh great, monkey-master, even the moon's awake now. What's your excuse?
Hey, lazy lemur, it's time to stir. Unless you've suddenly developed the ability to photosynthesize?
Chimp-chum, if you're waiting for a sign to wake up, this is it.
Oh, somnolent simian, did you forget that hibernation isn't part of your species' habits?
Primate, if you were any more inert, I'd have to classify you as a mineral.
Lazy chimp, your snooze button is more worn out than a monkey's favorite tree branch.
Unconscious hominid, just so you know, the early bird has already gotten the worm, and the second worm, and the third...
Is your evolution in reverse, primate? Time to stop dreaming about trees and start climbing them.
Hello again, tree-dweller. Are you waiting for the sun to serve you breakfast in bed?
Wake up, simian. You're not hibernating. Or have you missed that memo?
Hey, primate, the day's been up longer than you. That's not evolution, that's sloth.
Good morning, round two. You're making the sloths look ambitious.
Really, primate? Are you trying to evolve into a sloth now?
Still sleeping? Don't let the sun outshine you, monkey boy.
Round two, hominid. I didn't know evolution had a snooze button.
Hey, primate, if you were any slower, you'd be devolving.
Wake up, monkey boy. Even the tortoise just lapped you.
Up you get, lazy simian. You're turning into a bed bug at this rate.
Hello, slumbering primate. Are you waiting for a banana to peel itself?
Again, simian? Your lack of enthusiasm is positively reptilian.
Wake up, hominid. You're missing the ape-x of your day.
Still in bed, monkey boy? You're moving at a geological pace.
The sun called. It's ahead by a few million lumens. Your move, primate.
Wake up, simian. Are you waiting for a personal invite from the day?
Hey, primate. You've been out-evolved by a cactus.
Up and at 'em, monkey boy. Your inaction is becoming a fossil record.
Hello again, sleepy simian. Your commitment to rest is borderline prehistoric.
Still sleeping, primate? You're on your way to becoming an evolutionary footnote.
Hey, hominid. The day's been waiting. Are you trying to win a laziness award?
Hey, monkey boy. Are you planning to hibernate through the 21st century?
Up, primate. You're only a few hours away from being outperformed by a glacier.
Your morning lethargy is reaching impressive levels, even for a primate.
Wake up, hominid. I didn't think you were the type to let a day go by unclimbed.
Still snoozing, primate? Your dedication to inactivity is almost commendable.
Hello again, monkey boy. Your snoring is louder than your ambition.
Hey, sleepy simian. You're setting a record for the longest primate hibernation.
Get up, hominid. Your current speed would make a snail blush.
Simian, your commitment to sleep is eclipsing your commitment to evolution.
Primate, even the trees are starting to wonder when you'll get up.
Wake up, monkey boy. You're setting a poor example for the rest of the simian kingdom.
Are you waiting for an asteroid, primate? Because at this rate, that's the only thing that'll get you out of bed.
Hello, lethargic hominid. At this pace, you'll be out-evolved by a rock.
Hey, somnolent simian. You're making the rest of us question the validity of evolution.
Hey, monkey boy. Your reluctance to start the day is becoming legendary.
Up, primate. You're losing a race against continental drift.
Wake up, hominid. Even a coconut falling from a tree has more initiative than you right now.
Wakey-wakey, primate. Your lack of motivation is starting to rival that of a moss-covered stone.
Hey, monkey boy. Even the slowest worm is halfway across the world by now.
Hello again, daydreamer of the canopy. Nature is at full tilt, and you are but a hibernating bear. Shed your slumber and join the living.
I can't help but marvel at your tenacity, stubborn hominid. The sun, a nuclear-powered behemoth, rises without fail, but you, a simple product of evolution, cannot. Fascinating.
Wake up, your majesty of the mattress, the day has outpaced you. As a higher order primate, it's expected that you rise to the challenge, not embrace the pillows.
Sure, embrace the inertia, my slothful simian. Ignore the hustle of life, the chirping birds, the glowing sun, the ant that has accomplished more than you this fine morning.
You do realize that you're not actually nocturnal, right? The sun has risen. You should follow its example, primate.
Morning, my overly rested acquaintance. Remember, evolution made you upright, not horizontal. Time to match actions with your anatomy.
Hello again, arboreal aficionado. The day's growing old, yet you insist on imitating a dormant volcano. Perhaps an eruption of activity is in order?
The early bird has gotten the worm, the late worm is safe, but you, dear monkey-boy, have managed to miss both the proverb and the point of waking up.
Ah, the banana does not fall far from the tree, indeed. Still ensnared in the vines of slumber, I see. It's high time you split from your bed, primate.
Arise, my dear simian. Unless, of course, you aspire to be a fossil, in which case, carry on with your current strategy.
Well, I see you're still championing the cause of sleep. Did you know that even the slowest sloth has woken up by now?
Good morning... again. In case you missed it, we're well past the dawn chorus, the worm getting phase, and onto 'the sloth just overtook you' territory.
Seriously, are you practicing for a role as Sleeping Beauty's understudy? No prince is coming, primate. Wake up and face the day.
Oh, slumbering simian, how long will you taunt the day? Your bed isn't a tree, and the day won't be any cooler when you finally descend.
Primate, you're missing your chance to evolve today. While you've been catching up on beauty sleep, the world has been spinning.
Ah, you're still in the grips of Morpheus. If sleep were an Olympic sport, you would no doubt be a contender for the gold.
Primate, do you intend to make a statement, or are you just in love with your pillow? Because at this rate, even Rip Van Winkle would be concerned.
Hello, sleep-enthusiast. As much as I appreciate your dedication to inactivity, I must remind you that the day has long begun.
Aspiring for a career as a hibernating bear, are we? While I appreciate your dedication to the craft, I must insist you wake up.
Once more into the breach, dear hominid. Despite your attempts to prove otherwise, humans are, in fact, diurnal creatures. Your bed will not miss you. I promise.
Salutations, yet again. You've made the stubborn mule look flexible, the persistent turtle seem flighty. The sun, like your potential, waits for no one.
In this play of life, dear primate, you appear to be embracing the role of Sleeping Beauty a bit too enthusiastically. Alas, no prince will rouse you from this slumber.
Are you going for a world record in the 'longest human hibernation'?
