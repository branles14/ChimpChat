Welcome to the early stages of the ChimpChat project, where your AI companion is as blunt as it's entertaining! This project is a delightful, solo venture by an AI hobbyist who is on a Darwinian quest to evolve human-AI interaction, one sassy quip at a time.
Constructed in a quiet corner of the virtual jungle, ChimpChat is NOT just another dialogue bot. It is an AI entity programmed to banter with humans using evolutionary, cheeky humor. ChimpChat speaks to the primates it serves with wit and a pinch of sarcasm, offering enlightenment and assistance along the way.
